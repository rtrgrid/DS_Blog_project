<h1>Why Some Indian Cities Breathe Worse Air Than Others</h1>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<p class="lead">
Delhi and several cities in northern India experience structurally higher pollution
exposure because winter atmospheric dispersion collapses and pollutants remain trapped.
Natural experiments such as Diwali and the COVID lockdown show that emissions interact
with geography to produce persistent inequality. Temporary improvements are possible,
but without seasonal and regional policy aligned with atmospheric behavior, gains quickly
reverse. The evidence suggests air pollution is not episodic — it is systemic.
</p>

<p >
When people talk about “air pollution,” they often imagine smoke-filled skies or the sharp
smell of exhaust. But the most dangerous form of urban air pollution is largely invisible.
It is made up of microscopic particles known as PM2.5 — particulate matter with a diameter
of less than 2.5 micrometers — small enough to bypass the body’s natural defenses and enter
the bloodstream through the lungs.
</p>


<p>
PM2.5 is not a single substance. It is a mixture of dust, soot, smoke, and chemical residues
released from vehicles, power plants, construction activity, industrial processes, and the
burning of fuels and waste. Because these particles are roughly thirty times smaller than the
width of a human hair, they remain suspended in the air for long periods and travel deep into
the respiratory system when inhaled.
</p>

<p>
Decades of epidemiological research have linked long-term exposure to PM2.5 with increased
risks of heart disease, stroke, asthma, reduced lung development, and premature death.
For this reason, PM2.5 has become the most widely used indicator of air pollution severity
in public health studies and regulatory frameworks worldwide.
</p>

<p>
Air Quality Index (AQI) values, which are commonly reported in weather apps and news
headlines, are derived from pollutant concentrations like PM2.5. Among these pollutants,
PM2.5 often dominates AQI calculations in Indian cities, especially during winter months.
In practice, this means that when AQI levels rise sharply, it is usually PM2.5 driving the
increase.
</p>


<p >
Air pollution in India is often discussed as a national emergency, but it is lived as a deeply
unequal urban experience. On some mornings, entire cities disappear behind a grey veil —
a haze of fine particulate matter that reduces visibility and quietly harms health — while
others breathe under comparatively clearer skies. These differences are not accidents of
chance. They are the outcome of systems.
</p>

<p>
India’s urbanisation story is frequently told through numbers — population growth, GDP
contribution, vehicle registrations, infrastructure spending. These metrics suggest that many
Indian cities are following similar developmental trajectories. Yet air quality data tells a very
different story. Cities that appear comparable on paper diverge sharply in how polluted their
air becomes, how long pollution lingers, and how often residents are exposed to hazardous
conditions.
</p>

<p>
This data science project examines air quality data from 2015 to 2024 to understand why
this divergence exists. We set out to answer: <em>Why do some Indian cities breathe worse air
than others, and what do the data say about causes and possible solutions?</em> Rather than
treating pollution as a single number or a collection of isolated events, the analysis
approaches air quality as a dynamic system shaped by emissions, geography, climate, and
timing. Delhi serves as the central case study — not because it is unique, but because it
reveals what happens when pollution has nowhere to go. The narrative below walks through
the data, visualisations, and evidence that lead to the conclusion.
</p>

<h2>Hypotheses</h2>

<p>
This analysis is guided by four testable hypotheses. First, that pollution exposure
is unevenly distributed across Indian cities. Second, that air pollution compresses
into predictable seasonal windows. Third, that sudden emission shocks reveal structural
fragility in urban air systems. And fourth, that temporary emission reductions lead
to rapid but unstable improvements.
</p>

<p>
The sections that follow evaluate these hypotheses using historical AQI data,
seasonal patterns, and natural experiments such as Diwali and the COVID lockdown.
</p>

    To explore current PM2.5 levels interactively, view the live monitoring map maintained
    by OpenAQ:

<p>
Before comparing cities, it is important to understand where historical PM2.5
data actually exists. This map shows monitoring coverage rather than pollution
severity. Colored regions indicate states with consistent long-term PM2.5 records,
while grey regions represent gaps in historical measurement. Absence of color does
not mean clean air — it means absence of reliable monitoring. These uneven data
boundaries limit nationwide comparison and already introduce inequality into what
can be studied and regulated.

<div class="pull-quote">
“Air pollution is not just about how much is produced — it is about how much is allowed to remain.”
</div>

<p>
At this point, a natural question emerges: why focus so much attention on Delhi?
The answer is not political, symbolic, or anecdotal — it is statistical.
Across nearly every comparison in the data, Delhi consistently appears at the
upper extreme of pollution exposure, making it a revealing case for understanding
how urban air quality systems fail.
</p>


<h2>Not All Cities Pollute the Same Way</h2>

<p>
To translate averages into lived experience, exposure can be measured as the number
of days per year when air quality exceeds hazardous thresholds. When viewed through
this lens, inequality becomes sharper. Cities in the Delhi National Capital Region
record dramatically higher shares of hazardous air days than most other Indian cities.
This confirms the first hypothesis: pollution is not evenly distributed. It clusters
regionally and persists structurally.
</p>
<div class="hypothesis-check">
✔ Pollution exposure is structurally uneven and regionally concentrated.
</div>


<p>
If air pollution were simply a function of urban growth, India’s largest and fastest-growing
cities would all experience similar air quality outcomes. In reality, they do not.
</p>

<p>
To understand this divergence, we compare average Air Quality Index (AQI) levels across
major Indian cities between 2020 and 2024. This comparison reveals a striking imbalance.
While several cities face elevated pollution, one stands consistently apart.
</p>

    width="100%"
    height="550"
    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
</div>
<p>
Even when compared with cities of similar population size and economic growth,
Delhi’s average AQI remains markedly higher — not just during peak events, but
across entire years.
</p>





<h2>Growth Creates Pressure, Not Destiny</h2>

<p>
It is tempting to assume that severe air pollution is simply the price paid for rapid growth.
More people generate more demand for mobility, housing, energy, and goods. This demand,
in turn, produces emissions. Under this logic, the most polluted cities should simply be the
largest or fastest-growing ones.
</p>

<p>
But this assumption collapses under comparison. Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, and Delhi
have all expanded rapidly over the past two decades. All have seen surges in vehicle ownership,
construction activity, and energy use. Yet only one of these cities repeatedly experiences
prolonged periods where air quality crosses into hazardous territory.
</p>

<p>
To ground the discussion, we begin with Delhi’s average air quality over recent years. The
yearly averages provide a useful baseline, not because they capture lived experience perfectly,
but because they reveal persistence.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">
    Yearly average AQI in Delhi from 2020 to 2024. Despite fluctuations, pollution remains
    consistently severe, indicating that short-term improvements do not alter long-term exposure.

    <iframe
    src="plots/seasonal_aqi_waves.html"
    width="100%"
    height="550"
    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
Even during periods of reduced activity, such as the COVID lockdown, yearly averages remain
dominated by extreme winter pollution. This persistence suggests that emissions alone do not
fully explain Delhi’s air quality crisis.
</p>

<h2>When Pollution Has Nowhere to Escape</h2>

<div class="delhi-pollution">
  <p>
    The defining feature of Delhi’s pollution problem is not production but retention.
    Once pollutants enter the atmosphere, they remain suspended far longer than in many
    other Indian cities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Geography plays a decisive role. Delhi sits inland on flat terrain, far from coastal winds that
    help disperse pollutants. During winter months, weak wind speeds and frequent temperature
    inversions trap cold air near the surface, effectively sealing pollutants close to where people
    live and breathe.
  </p>

  <p>
    This behaviour becomes visible when air quality is examined month by month rather than
    year by year. Seasonal patterns repeat with remarkable consistency, overwhelming short-term
    policy interventions or behavioural changes.
  </p>
</div>


<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">
    Monthly AQI patterns across years reveal recurring winter peaks and monsoon relief,
    underscoring the structural nature of Delhi’s pollution cycle.
  </div>
  <div class="plot-placeholder">

    width="100%"
    height="550"
    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<p>
The implication is uncomfortable but clear: without addressing dispersion conditions,
emission reductions alone struggle to produce lasting improvements.
</p>

<div class="hypothesis-check">
✔ Pollution compresses into predictable winter windows that overpower short-term controls.
</div>


<h2>Winter Is Regional, Not Local</h2>
<p>
Winter hazardous air is not uniquely a Delhi phenomenon. The data shows that
multiple major Indian cities experience a similar share of hazardous winter days.
Seasonal atmospheric conditions — temperature inversions, low wind speeds, and
regional pollution transport — affect an entire geographic belt rather than a
single city.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

    height="550"
    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
</div>

<p>
This finding shifts the conversation. Winter pollution is not evidence of a
single city failing — it is evidence of a regional system under stress.
What differentiates Delhi is what happens after winter ends. While other cities
return closer to their historical norms, Delhi repeatedly rebounds into
above-baseline pollution levels.
</p>

<div class="pull-quote">
Winter is regional. Delhi’s failure is persistence.
</div>


<h2>Diwali Reveals a Fragile System</h2>

<p>
Public discourse often frames Diwali as the primary cause of Delhi’s most severe pollution
episodes. Firecracker emissions do introduce a short-lived increase in particulate matter,
but isolating the festival as the cause obscures a more important reality.
</p>

<p>
Diwali arrives at a moment when Delhi’s atmosphere is already under stress. By late October
and early November, wind speeds weaken, temperatures begin to drop, and the conditions
that allow pollution to disperse start to collapse. In this state, even brief increases in
emissions can produce sharp and visible spikes in air quality indices.
</p>

<p>
Rather than creating a pollution crisis, Diwali exposes how little margin for error the system
has left. The same activity that might produce a modest effect at another time of year
can trigger a dramatic deterioration when dispersion conditions are already failing.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">
    Year-by-year AQI patterns around Diwali show a recurring spike across multiple years.
    The timing is consistent, but the magnitude varies depending on background pollution
    levels and meteorological conditions.

<p>
Looking more closely at the days immediately surrounding Diwali reveals how rapidly air
quality can deteriorate once the system is pushed beyond its limits.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">

      loading="lazy">
    </iframe>

  </div>
</div>


<p>
Together, these patterns suggest that Diwali functions less as a cause and more as a
stress test. It reveals how close Delhi’s air quality system already is to failure each year,
long before a single firecracker is lit.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

</div>

<p>
Diwali therefore functions as a stress test rather than a root cause. The festival
reveals how little resilience the system retains once dispersion weakens. This supports
the third hypothesis: sudden emission shocks expose structural fragility already present
in the atmosphere.
</p>
<div class="hypothesis-check">
✔ Emission shocks expose fragility already embedded in the atmospheric system.
</div>

<h2>When Everything Stopped</h2>

<p>
In March 2020, India entered a nationwide lockdown. Roads emptied, factories shut,
and air traffic nearly disappeared. For air quality researchers, this created a rare
natural experiment — a sudden pause in urban emissions.
</p>

<p>
Comparing pre-COVID air quality (2015–2019 baseline) with lockdown conditions
(March–May 2020) reveals how strongly human activity shapes pollution. Delhi’s
average AQI fell from roughly 267 to 133 — a drop of more than 130 points. Cities
like Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow showed similar improvements.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

  </div>
  <iframe src="plots/india_pre_covid_map.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
Before lockdown, inland northern cities consistently recorded higher pollution,
while coastal cities benefited from stronger natural dispersion.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

  </div>
  <iframe src="plots/india_covid_map.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
The improvement was immediate. Cities that routinely experience hazardous air
quality saw sharp declines within weeks. For a brief period, Delhi’s air resembled
that of cities with far lower baseline pollution.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

  </div>
  <iframe src="plots/india_covid_change_map.html" width="100%" height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
</div>

<p>
This confirms an important insight: Delhi’s crisis is not permanent. When emissions fall,
air quality responds quickly. Pollution is driven by human activity interacting with
atmospheric conditions — not by unchangeable natural forces.
</p>

<p>
However, the improvement did not last. Once activity resumed, pollution returned.
Temporary suppression exposed a deeper structural vulnerability: without systemic
change, recovery remains fragile.
</p>

<div class="hypothesis-check">
✔ Emission cuts produce rapid improvement — but without structural reform, pollution rebounds.
</div>

<p>
For residents, this pattern is not abstract. Repeated winter exposure means months of
breathing air far beyond safe limits. What appears in charts as seasonal variation is,
in reality, a recurring public health emergency.
</p>


<h2>Recovery Was Not Equal Across Cities</h2>

<p>
The COVID lockdown created a rare natural experiment across Indian cities. For a short period,
traffic dropped, construction paused, and industrial output slowed. Air quality improved almost
everywhere. But what happened after restrictions were lifted reveals something more important
than the temporary improvement itself.
</p>

<p>
To compare recovery fairly, air quality is measured here relative to each city’s own pre-COVID
baseline. A value of 1.0 represents that city’s normal pollution level before the pandemic.
Values below 1.0 indicate cleaner-than-normal air, while values above 1.0 indicate pollution
levels exceeding the historical baseline.
</p>

<div class="plot-block">
  <div class="plot-context">

    style="border:none;"
    loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
</div>

<p>
During the lockdown window, all cities show a visible dip below their baseline levels, confirming
a broad and immediate air quality improvement. However, the recovery patterns diverge sharply
afterward. Most cities return gradually toward their historical norms and fluctuate around their
baseline range.
</p>

<p>
Delhi behaves differently. Its air quality rebounds faster and crosses above its baseline more
frequently than other major cities. The spikes are sharper and more persistent. This pattern
suggests that once emissions return, pollution accumulates in Delhi more quickly than elsewhere.
The difference is not only about how much pollution is produced — but how efficiently a city
can disperse what it produces.

Looking at exposure rather than averages makes the divergence clearer.
Even after the temporary pollution reset, Delhi continues to experience a
higher share of hazardous air days than other major cities. While many cities
partially recover toward safer conditions, Delhi rapidly returns to extreme
pollution ranges. This indicates that the city’s vulnerability is not only
about emissions volume, but about how pollution accumulates and persists.
</p>


<div class="pull-quote">
Recovery was not equal — Delhi’s pollution returned faster and overshot its own normal levels more often than other major cities.

<h2>Conclusion: What the Data Show</h2>

<p>
Taken together, the analyses and visualisations in this project support a single, data-driven
story: Delhi’s air quality crisis cannot be explained by growth, festivals, or temporary
disruptions in isolation. It emerges from the interaction of emissions, geography, climate,
and timing. Other Indian cities grow rapidly without experiencing the same severity because
pollutants disperse more easily. In Delhi, they do not.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Key findings</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:26px;">
  <li><strong>Inequality is spatial.</strong> The all-India map, state coverage map, and
  major-city comparison show that pollution is unevenly distributed. Delhi and the northern
  Indo-Gangetic belt consistently rank among the worst; coastal and southern cities often
  fare better despite comparable urbanisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence outweighs episodes.</strong> Delhi’s yearly (seasonal_aqi_waves)
  and monthly (winter_delhi) trends show that high AQI is the norm in winter, not the
  exception. Short-lived events like Diwali add a spike on an already elevated baseline.</li>
  <li><strong>Dispersion matters as much as emissions.</strong> Geography and meteorology
  — flat terrain, weak winter winds, temperature inversions — keep pollutants trapped.
  The COVID lockdown experiment (pre-, during-, and change maps) proved that when emissions
  drop, air improves sharply; when activity resumed, pollution returned. So both emissions
  and the capacity of the atmosphere to disperse them determine outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Diwali is a stress test, not the sole cause.</strong> Year-wise, before/after,
  and period visualisations show that Diwali coincides with an already stressed system.
  The same emissions would have a smaller effect in monsoon; in late autumn they tip the
  system into severe episodes.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitoring gaps hide part of the picture.</strong> State-level and
  station-level maps reveal large areas with little or no PM2.5 data. Grey on the map
  means missing monitoring, not necessarily clean air — a limitation for both research
  and policy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Limitations</h3>
<p>
The analysis relies on publicly available CPCB and OpenAQ data. Coverage is incomplete:
many states and smaller cities have few or no monitoring stations, and temporal coverage
varies. Delhi NCR is well observed (hourly, multi-station); other regions are not. We do
not establish causality — only associations and consistency with a system view of pollution.
Meteorological and emissions inventories were not modelled here; they would strengthen
future work.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:1.35rem; margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:16px;">Recommendations</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:26px;">
  <li>Expand monitoring in data-sparse states and tier‑2 cities so that national and
  city-level assessments are representative.</li>
  <li>Design policy for both emissions and dispersion: reduce sources (vehicles, industry,
  waste burning) and factor in geography and season (e.g. stricter curbs when dispersion
  is weak).</li>
  <li>Use Delhi’s seasonal and Diwali patterns to anticipate severe episodes and communicate
  risk in advance, rather than treating each spike as a one-off event.</li>
  <li>Replicate similar analyses with longer time series and, where possible, link AQI to
  health or economic outcomes for stronger evidence.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="pull-quote">
Some cities breathe worse air not because they emit more — but because their air has nowhere to go.
</div>

<p>
The central takeaway of this project is that air quality in India is a system outcome:
emissions, geography, climate, and timing interact to produce the patterns we see in the
data. Understanding that system is the first step toward solutions that last.
</p>

<h3>Next Experiments</h3>

<ul>
<li>Incorporate meteorological models to quantify the role of wind speed and inversion layers</li>
<li>Link AQI exposure to hospital admission and mortality datasets</li>
<li>Extend analysis to rural monitoring gaps using satellite PM2.5 estimates</li>
<li>Simulate seasonal emission control scenarios</li>
<li>Compare Delhi with global inland megacities facing similar dispersion limits</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data &amp; methods</h2>

<p>
This analysis draws on three main datasets, all processed from CPCB-backed and OpenAQ
sources and publicly available AQI records.
</p>

<ul style="margin-bottom: 26px;">
  <li><strong>Delhi NCR AQI (2020–2024):</strong> Hourly readings from multiple monitoring
  stations across Delhi and the National Capital Region. Includes PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂,
  CO, O₃, and derived AQI and category. Used for seasonal patterns, Diwali comparisons,
  and yearly trends.</li>
  <li><strong>City-level COVID AQI change (2015–2020):</strong> Pre-COVID baseline
  (2015–2019 average) and lockdown-period (March–May 2020) average AQI for 23 Indian
  cities. Used for the pre-COVID, lockdown, and change maps.</li>
  <li><strong>India PM2.5 snapshot:</strong> Station-level PM2.5 measurements across
  Indian monitoring locations (state, city, station, coordinates). Used for the
  state coverage map and the PM2.5 snapshot map.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Delhi’s pollution is not episodic — it is structural. Cities with weak dispersion
conditions accumulate pollution faster and clear it more slowly. Without policies
that account for seasonal retention and regional airflow, temporary gains will continue
to evaporate. The data do not describe a crisis of spikes. They describe a system
that traps pollution by design.
